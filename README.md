# Readme

This repo will provide guidance for the wind project

# Big Goal
Given a dataset, find a way to detect real high wind speed scenarios.
With a method to detect real high wind speed scenarios, develop algorithm to predict them.

# Challenges
- The wind speed data is not clean.  It will be important to remove time intervals that are obviously not use-able.  For example, there may be periods when the windspeed values are all NaN, blank or zero.
- Some wind speed data is clearly not real.  For example, some wind speeds recorded may be HIGHER than the world record for wind speeds.
- The wind speed data is a large and organized in a manner that may not be conducive for what you want to do.  This is an opportunity to practice with AWS s3.  Try transferring a small amount of the data to an AWS s3 for further work.
